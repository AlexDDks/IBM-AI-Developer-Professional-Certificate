A high availability replica of the database is often also used to ensure reliability.

A firewall is a security device that monitors traffic between networks. It permits or blocks requested data based on a set of security rules. It acts as a barrier between networks to block viruses, malware, and hackers from accessing the internal network.

The purpose of load balancers is to distribute network traffic efficiently amongst multiple servers, called a server farm, on a network. Load balancers are used to prevent server traffic overload and are located between clients and the servers. A load balancer determines which servers are capable of fulfilling those requirements in a manner that maximizes availability and responsiveness.

Web and application servers are either software or machines that provides services, resources, data, or applications to another computer program, called the client.

Servers store, process, and manage network data, devices, and systems. A web server delivers content such as web pages, files, images, and videos to a client.

An app server is a server that runs business logic and provides the application to the client rather than the client running the app on their own machine.

A proxy server is an intermediate server that sits in between two tiers and handles requests between those tiers. A proxy server can serve multiple purposes such as load balancing, system optimization, caching, acting as a firewall, obscuring the source of the request, encryption, scanning for malware, and more. And a proxy server can improve the efficiency, privacy, and security of data flowing through a network.

Finally, a database is a collection of related data, stored on a computer that can be accessed in various ways. A database is usually controlled by software called a database management system or DBMS. The DBMS controls a database by connecting the database to users or other programs. The database server controls the flow and storage of data.
