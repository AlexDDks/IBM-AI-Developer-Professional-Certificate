Object-oriented analysis and design, or OOAD for short, is an approach for analyzing and designing a software system when the system will use object-oriented programming languages to develop it.

At the heart of OOAD are objects. Objects contain data, and they also have behaviors that prescribe the actions the object can take. 

Class diagrams are commonly used to communicate a software systemâ€™s structure in OOAD. The class diagram shows how the classes in an object-oriented design relate to one another. Each box represents a class and shows its attributes.
