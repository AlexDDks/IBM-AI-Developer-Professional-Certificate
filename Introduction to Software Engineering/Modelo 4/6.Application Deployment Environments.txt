An application environment is the combination of the hardware and software resources required to run an application. This includes: the application code and/or binary executables for its various components or modules the software stack it requires for running the application such as modules and libraries it depends on, third party applications and middleware, and the operating system, any networking components and infrastructure, as well as any physical or virtual hardware including computing or processing resources, memory, and storage. 

The pre-production environments are those platforms that the application resides on in various forms as it gets prepared for production. Common pre-production environments are “development,” “QA,” which stands for quality assurance, and “staging.”

The development environment is the platform on which the application is being actively coded, and in many cases it may just be the developer's workstation. The QA environment, sometimes called “testing” is the environment that allows the QA team to test the application’s components. The staging environment is the environment that is as close to replicating the production environment as possible but is not meant for general users.
