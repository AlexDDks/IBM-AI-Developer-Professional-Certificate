Some organizations that follow Agile development methodologies may call a team a squad. Typically, a squad is a small team of up to 10 developers. It is likely to consist of: A squad leader who acts as the anchor developer and coach for the squad. And a few software engineers who develop and implement the product features and test cases. It may also include one or two user experience developers or designers.
