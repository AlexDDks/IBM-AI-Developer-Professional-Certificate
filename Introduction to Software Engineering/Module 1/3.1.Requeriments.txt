Requirement gathering is a six-step process of defining a problem to be solved and documenting how to go about solving that problem. These steps include: identifying stakeholders, establishing goals and objectives, eliciting requirements from the stakeholders, documenting the requirements, analyzing and confirming the requirements, and prioritizing.

Typically, there may be three documents that result from the requirements gathering process: software requirements specification, or SRS, user requirements specification, or URS, and system requirements specification, or SysRS. The most common of these is the software requirements specification. 

The software requirements specification, or SRS, is a document that captures the functionalities that the software should perform and also establishes benchmarks or service levels for its performance.

Parts of an SRS include: A purpose statement that contains the intended use of the SRS, its audience and scope, constraints, assumptions and dependencies, and requirements, which can be sorted into four categories: Functional requirements External Interface requirements System Features Non-functional requirements

Requirements can be classified into four categories. Functional requirements are those that cover the functionalities of the software. 

External requirements are the requirements that address the behavior of the software in relation to external entities such as users and interactions with other hardware or software.

System features are a subset of functional requirements. These are required features for the system to function. 

here are also non-functional requirements such as specifying performance, safety, security, and quality standards. User requirements describe the business need and expectations of the end-users from the software system.
