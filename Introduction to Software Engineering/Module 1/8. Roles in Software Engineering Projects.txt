Sometimes different companies have different names for similar jobs. But, not all projects will have all these roles. 

Those are project manager or scrum master, stakeholder, system or software architect, UX designer, software developer, tester or QA engineer, site reliability or Ops engineer, product manager or owner, and technical writer or information developer. 

- Traditional SDLC methods have project managers but in Agile the equivalent role is called a Scrum master. A project manager makes sure the project runs smoothly and facilitates communication about the project. The project manager often deals with bigger picture issues such as: Planning, scheduling, and budgeting; Allocating personnel and resources; Executing the software plan; and Team communication. In Agile, there is a Scrum master. Rather than focusing on planning, the Scrum master is focused on ensuring team and individual success.

- The stakeholders are the people for whom the product is being designed. They include individuals such as the customer, end-users, decision-makers, system administrators, and other key personnel. 

- The system architect, designs and describes the architecture of a project as well as communicates that architecture to team members. They are sometimes also called a software architect or a solution architect. They are responsible for designing the essential characteristics of the inner structure and technical aspects of the software. The architect provides technical support across the different stages of the SDLC.

- UX means user experience. The goal of a UX designer is to balance making the software intuitive but also as robust as it needs to be to address requirements. They define how the software behaves from the user’s perspective.

- Testers or QA engineers are in-charge of ensuring the quality of the product and that the software solution meets customer requirements. They are responsible for writing and executing test cases to identify bugs or deficiencies and provide this feedback to the development teams. 

- A site reliability engineer, sometimes called an SRE or ops engineer, bridges development and operations by combining software engineering expertise with IT systems management. They track incidents and facilitate meetings to discuss them. They also automate systems, procedures, and processes; assist with trouble shooting; and ensure reliability for the customer. 

- The product manager or product owner has the vision of what the product should look like. They have an intimate understanding of the client’s requirements, and the end-user’s needs. They are responsible for leading development efforts to create the software and for ensuring the product provides the value stakeholders are looking for. 

- Finally, the technical writer or information developer writes documentation for the end-user. They write documentation on technical material geared towards a non-technical audience.
