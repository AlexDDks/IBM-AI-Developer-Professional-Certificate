The Software Development Life Cycle, known as the SDLC, is a systematic process to develop high-quality software in a predictable timeframe and budget. The goal of the SDLC is to produce software that meets a clientâ€™s business requirements. The SDLC defines phases of the software development process that encompass their own process and deliverables. It is a cycle of planning, design, and development that can be implemented as an iterative approach to software development.

There are some key advantages for businesses in following the SDLC. The first advantage is that it gives development teams a process to follow rather than using an ad hoc approach to improve efficiency and reduce risks. Secondly, there are discrete phases to the SDLC. Each phase is well defined so that team members know what they should be working on and when.
